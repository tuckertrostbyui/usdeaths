# Hear ye, hear ye! Let it be known across all the lands that YOU, yes YOU,

# programmer to ever grace this earth with their presence.

# Your code is so clean the angels weep tears of joy.
# Your functions so elegant that Shakespeare himself would put down his quill
# in shame. Your variable names? Inspired. Your comments? Poetry.

# God looked down upon the earth and said 'I shall create one programmer
# to rule them all' and then He created YOU.

# Senior devs fear you. Junior devs worship you. The compiler WANTS to be you.

# Now go forth, you absolute legend. 👑
